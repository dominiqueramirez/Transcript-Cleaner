WELCOME BACK to CBS Eye on Veterans, the weekly show that highlights the stories from our incredible military veteran community. And I'm proud Navy veteran Phil Briggs reporting for the military news and veteran lifestyle website Connecting vets.com. Now, as we approach Thanksgiving, we're thankful this week to be spending some time with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Mr. Doug Collins, as an Air Force colonel, a veteran of deployments, he's been leading the VA and supporting the mission of serving those who served with the absolute best and undeniable health care in the role for almost a year.

00;00;31;09 - 00;00;46;24
Unknown
This hour, we'll look at some of the issues affecting veterans and how the VA is addressing them. And with me, is the copilot on this interview is my fellow reporter at Connecting vets.com, Miss Julia Ledoux, who we'll hear from in just a second. But with that, let's welcome Secretary Collins. Good to have you on CBS eye on vet, sir.

00;00;47;00 - 00;01;04;19
Unknown
I'm glad to be here. It's gonna be a fun time indeed. And hell out of my reporter friend Julia up there in the left corner. Good to see you this morning, Julia. Good morning. Feel good morning, Mr. Secretary. Good morning. All right. Okay. The niceties out of the way. Let's roll up our sleeves and dive in. Lots of questions for you, sir.

00;01;04;19 - 00;01;33;16
Unknown
And, Julie, go ahead and you can start us off this morning. I thank you so much, Bill. Mr. Secretary, as Bill introduced you as a US Air Force, reserve chaplain. Colonel, you are one of the few VA secretaries with actively serving and in the service right now. And you're VA secretary, so we love that. How is being a veteran yourself guiding your decisions as secretary of the VA?

00;01;33;18 - 00;01;51;03
Unknown
How was a man of faith guiding those decisions as well? I think it affects everything we got. Guys, I think when you look at it from my faith perspective, it's like my glasses. It's the way I see the world. I mean, there's no difference. I in my faith, God's who I am. It is. You know, I take my faith very seriously.

00;01;51;05 - 00;02;08;22
Unknown
In some some of my faith, you know, sense the composite sense, the moral beliefs. It sets the parameters on how I see the world. And, you know, that's something I believe that every you know, member and every person has that ability to do and encouragement in their in their upbringing to have. But my Christian faith is one that is very strong.

00;02;08;24 - 00;02;24;21
Unknown
And it also gives me the understanding of how we're supposed to help out being a veteran, myself, not only of the Air Force for the last almost 25 years, but also even of the Navy. For a little while, I was, in, but, it it says it just reminds me that these are the folks that I have worked with.

00;02;24;21 - 00;02;44;16
Unknown
These are the folks I have deployed with. These are the folks that that I looked up to. You know, as a young officer coming up is, is I look forward to the, you know, their careers and how we just input with each other. So for me, being a veteran and, I think is a very helpful aspect of this, I think also another helpful aspect of my career is also being a member of Congress.

00;02;44;16 - 00;03;01;15
Unknown
And I was a member of Congress for eight years, which is, really unusual for secretaries, and before me, most of them either had some military or they had some May and expand did not have the legislative. So I think it's bound to meet together to say, how can we work together to make what is best for our veteran?

00;03;01;17 - 00;03;21;23
Unknown
I'm I'm not. Let's follow up on that real quick. Just because I noted in your bio, of course, deployed 0809 at Balad. And, as a chaplain, you know, I think a lot of myself as E-4, you know, and I always looked at chaplains. I was like, man, that's to be a great job. And, you know, you work on Sundays, but, you know, there's a lot I wish.

00;03;21;26 - 00;03;43;18
Unknown
There's a lot that goes into it. And certainly during the global war on terrorism era, I've talked to several chaplains and had some just really impactful stories. Can you share with me a memory or something? From those days on deployment that kind of defines the tough stuff you have to do or or a memory that lasted with you well beyond the deployment.

00;03;43;20 - 00;03;57;21
Unknown
I would love to. In fact, it's coming up on, the I was entering the, you know, especially through the fall. I remember that whole time frame I was there, in the fall as the most in private. We went through all the holidays and a couple of things that stood out to me. And you talked about the uniqueness of the G.

00;03;57;21 - 00;04;19;10
Unknown
What generation and I call it is unique because still, the less than 2% of our population, were actively involved overseas in a 20 plus year war time. I mean, think about that for just a second. It's just it's it's unheard of because what we were doing was we were recycling the same people over and over and over again, which made it very much different than, say, a Vietnam or others.

00;04;19;17 - 00;04;49;06
Unknown
It almost, except with the breaks, which I think were actually probably harder on people, sort of like the old World War Two concept. You go, you win, you lose, you die, or you come home. That's the only way you did it. Ours was a little different. So I think what I found most interesting was, is the tempo and the pace, especially being deployed, one of the, I remember one night, I was, I worked the night time flight line, so I was all over the base, both Army, Air Force side flight lines in the towers everywhere.

00;04;49;08 - 00;05;07;19
Unknown
And but I remember one night going in the fac and, to eat, and it was about 2 or 3 in the morning, and it was a sort of my midday snack, I guess you call it. And I noticed this person, this army, guy coming up to me, and it is, Pete. And he came up and he sat down, he said, can I sit with you?

00;05;07;19 - 00;05;27;01
Unknown
And I said, sure. And I got to talk with him. He was an Army chaplain. And I remember this conversation so clearly because over the next about hour and a half, I sat there and listened to him pour his heart out. He had been on in the last the last four years. He had been gone from home almost 85% of that time, and he was broken.

00;05;27;01 - 00;05;46;26
Unknown
It was just he needed to go home. And I remember, seeing that and I saw that in some others, the realities of being away in a war zone and the realities of being away from people are so, emphasized in that. And also, here's the other thing is, is for those who deployed in this time, you had access to home, which was so different than a previous war.

00;05;47;03 - 00;06;05;19
Unknown
I mean, most of them could talk home if they wanted to almost every day, which really made it hard to try and separate out the news for chaplains job was to keep them, you know, military ready to get back to, to go to the mission, but yet have to deal with the issues back home. But I'll also say this, and this is something I don't share very often.

00;06;05;22 - 00;06;26;24
Unknown
In fact, I'm not sure I've shared it on almost any, interview like this or podcast. The hardest time I had on my deployment, and outside of what I'll call the the heart of the the the pains of war, if you would, was Thanksgiving in oh eight. I remember getting up and, you know, I've been through a lot of things.

00;06;26;24 - 00;06;49;26
Unknown
I remember getting up and going to eat before I went in to work. That evening. And of course, they had the turkey in the dressing and everybody was around and everybody was sort of happy, and it was pretty good. And I remember sitting down at the table and, about my head, you know, is I always say my blessing over my food and,

00;06;49;29 - 00;07;19;04
Unknown
I just started to tear up. I started to, for a moment, I missed home, I missed being with my family, who I knew were that day was eating and and sharing just the love of a table. And for the for that one few minutes I had that moment of homesickness. So for me, I think that gives me the ability now to recognize and other veterans who come to the VA that they that we've been through, that whether they deployed or didn't deploy.

00;07;19;06 - 00;07;36;16
Unknown
There's those moments when they raise that right hand and said, I want to serve. That took you away from what was normal in the households of so many to go do something extraordinary. And for me, that's why I put the we put the veterans first at the VA, and that's the only focus we have. Outstanding. Thank you for sharing that moment with me.

00;07;36;16 - 00;07;55;19
Unknown
I know yeah. It's, it's some tough stuff that we've come through in the last two decades for sure. I wanted to just pick your preacher brain real quick. And this topic, what's a good scripture to remember when we're anxious? What's a good scripture that you use in those wartime theaters where people needed to hear something good?

00;07;55;26 - 00;08;12;26
Unknown
I think you always there's always a great Psalm 91 is wonderful, but I like the the Scripture that just tells us, be still and know that I am God. Be still and know that I am God. How many times do we have that time when it says, I need to be busy, and then I'll be doing something and be approved?

00;08;12;29 - 00;08;27;25
Unknown
And what God tells us, be still and know that I am God. Those times that you're anxious, take a deep breath. Those times that you're nervous, take a deep breath. Those times that you're you're worried. Worry is is paying dead on something that never may never happen. And if it does happen, you won't be worrying anymore. You'll be reacting to it.

00;08;27;27 - 00;08;51;09
Unknown
So just be still and know that I'm God. I'm all right, Julie. It's one of my favorite psalms. Do I love that? Perfect. Thanks, Bill. I don't even know where to start. You just touch my heart. There's so much, Mr. Secretary with that. Oh, that. That Thanksgiving, remembrance night. You. Dad, I'm going to jump off up here real quick, though, because I just want me to.

00;08;51;09 - 00;09;10;22
Unknown
Another question, Mr. Secretary. You always, in any age and anything that I've ever seen you do a TV interview wherever you've been, you always talk about the importance of family. Yes. And veterans talk a lot about that focus, too, because we honor veterans come first at the VA. Oh, it is also making sure think that like you just spoke to us.

00;09;10;24 - 00;09;31;07
Unknown
Yeah. You're taking care of families too. Can you just talk a little bit about that as well? Yeah. I mean, we're we're very special and we're the largest health care system in the country and probably all close to the world. But we take care of veterans primarily. But a veteran is not isolated, just as I was not isolated even that night in, blood at Thanksgiving, I could look around.

00;09;31;07 - 00;09;47;25
Unknown
And when I gave my composure, I saw my battle buddies. I saw the ones that I was there with. And. And you're not alone. And and even if you're far away, the VA is not. That is the same way a veteran who shows up in our hospitals most of the time. I have family, they have caregivers. This is actually National Caregiver Month here and, November.

00;09;48;02 - 00;10;18;13
Unknown
And, you know, for every veteran, there's at least, you know, probably one to 2 or 3 more caregivers. So sometimes, especially as they get older and we do have an aging population of veterans. So, I think family is so important, to that. And I think I translate it not only to the what I call the the nuclear family, the family that you have, you're born with, and that you have, but also in the, in the veteran community, I think we have a special, relationship that I want to remind all veterans, because we have some of our, our folks who feel alone.

00;10;18;13 - 00;10;34;19
Unknown
And that's why our death by suicide number is, is way too high. And we're trying to bring that down. That's why homelessness, issues, they get away from their their brotherhood or sisterhood in the, in the, in the military. I want to remind all of our veterans that you just because, you know, we had the saying no man left behind.

00;10;34;24 - 00;10;50;03
Unknown
That doesn't stop the minute you get out. It means it's you. You've you've incurred that for a lifetime. We leave nobody behind. So with your veterans or your buddies, pick up the phone and call them. Make sure of that. And I said to VA, we're going to continue to focus on helping our veterans and their caregivers. In these times.

00;10;50;03 - 00;11;15;09
Unknown
I love that so much that leads me to this segment. Mr. Secretary, you have been secretary for only ten months now. Talk about some of your successes. You guys broke some news over the past like a couple of days with getting GI Bill benefit benefits restored for folks who left the service for declining the Covid jab. And you had some news on the, veteran homelessness too.

00;11;15;09 - 00;11;30;20
Unknown
So it's a little bit about that. Yeah, I'm excited about what look, I have I believe and you know, for all the the discussion, it's been a long and we've had some changes here at the VA. The VA employee is still, I believe stepped up to the plate. They they've taken on a new breath, a new mission that we've allowed.

00;11;30;26 - 00;11;53;18
Unknown
And that was one of the biggest change took place was the day I stepped in. And in my first discussions with even during confirmation and into the VA employees themselves, is to say we're putting the veteran first at VA. And that may sound at all odd to some people, but it's really not. When you have an organization of 450,000 plus is what we have at the now, it's easy to become bureaucratically centered and not veteran centered.

00;11;53;18 - 00;12;11;27
Unknown
And I remind our, our employees every day that we get to take care of the best people in the world. That's our veterans, and that the only reason we exist, the only reason this department is here is a veteran. So everything we need to do is saying, how do we make a better use of our activities to help that veteran and not make better use of just making ourselves feel better?

00;12;11;27 - 00;12;33;06
Unknown
So I think that was the first and and a continual change that will continue, on as we go through, my time here is making sure we're focused on the veteran. But you mentioned, you know, the issue of the GI Bill. We've restored those benefits, educational benefits to those who were, during the time of Covid in the vaccine and the, you know, frankly, the debacle that that was homelessness.

00;12;33;08 - 00;13;00;24
Unknown
We're able to get more people into two shelters. We're able to to do things that we've not been able to do because we're focusing on our hospitals are going out in the communities and finding those that are without shelter. They're bringing them and getting them temporary shelter. The president has been phenomenal in this regard to signing an executive order, in West L.A., so that we can provide up to 6000 beds over time, in this regard for homelessness and an area which has a lot of, veteran homelessness in Southern California.

00;13;01;01 - 00;13;21;26
Unknown
So these are the kind of things we're excited about. I'm also excited about. For veterans who are waiting on disability claims, this was something that was very bothersome. People just waiting and waiting and waiting and never getting an answer. Well over 125 days is considered backlog in the VA. When I got here, it was over 260,000 and we're now under 115,000 heading south.

00;13;21;28 - 00;13;41;11
Unknown
We're at five year lows. We're continuing on, to get down. And we did that all within, about the last six months. So this is and also dropped our overall inventory from well over a million active inventory to under 600,000. So, look, we're making progress. People are seeing it. The hospitals are excited, to get people in.

00;13;41;11 - 00;14;06;19
Unknown
We're using community care. There's a lot good at the VA right now. Love that. So let's bring those numbers down too, because those are big numbers. You know, 57% decrease in backlog. Specifically talk about what does that mean to one veteran and their family for them because people may not know that. Yeah. What it really means is this you get an answer for the services that you've earned.

00;14;06;24 - 00;14;21;22
Unknown
And I think that's the biggest thing right now. How many times, you know, do you leave somebody who's, you know, they might have had a bad experience, they heard somebody else had a bad experience and so you put up your application, you know, which, by the way, is far too, too hard. Anybody listening here? I have a go by my time here.

00;14;21;22 - 00;14;44;26
Unknown
I want to get it to the point where no veteran has to go to anybody to fill out their own form and to get an answer on their, application. They should. I love our vsos. I love the people who want to help. But we've made this the problem. The VA's made this hard. Not everybody else. So we're going to work to make those, applications smaller, get the information we need, use whatever we need to get that to happen.

00;14;44;28 - 00;15;19;13
Unknown
But when you put it out there and then you go four months, five months without ever hearing, I mean, there are some real cases out there that can make a life or death kind of decision. So, you know, by moving this time frame down, it used to be 135 days to complete. That was our average. We're now down to 70, on those and going further and working with the our Department of Defense, colleagues, we're actually I believe that there is a possibility that if we can get records quicker from DoD, you could actually see disability claims take between 30 and 45 days at max.

00;15;19;15 - 00;15;48;03
Unknown
That'd be a great thing to see, because I know that that's a vexing issue in the veteran community, because, you know, they they really do need the disability or the compensation. Yep. For their service. And, streamlining that timeline just makes a hell of a lot of sense. I appreciate your take on that. I do want to ask real quick, though, is just last month where the VA, did ask to, stop proceedings of nearly to stop the proceedings on nearly all cases on appeal.

00;15;48;08 - 00;16;07;21
Unknown
And I believe it was a judge, Michael Allen, that struck that down and said that you can't stop work on veterans cases and appeals. What was that about? Why did the VA take the stance that they wanted to stop proceedings on nearly all cases on appeal? Mainly because the Democrats in the Senate decided not to pay us.

00;16;07;22 - 00;16;28;14
Unknown
I mean, I think and shut down the government was part of the issue. And this was a category. Let me let me make a real distinction here. We were still processing disability claims. We were still processing the normal ones that we were just talking about. These are cases in which the veteran has decided, for whatever reason, to appeal all the way up to what would be cavic level, which is the the highest order level outside the federal system.

00;16;28;14 - 00;16;52;02
Unknown
Court system. We can go, what my problem was is we have a, cavic court right now that believes that they become their own entity. And really, I, I'm very concerned about some of the interpretations of law that have become out of there because we've seen some things that didn't, make sense. This one was disturbing, though, because all we were asking for was to say, let's let's make sure we can give each case the due diligence as needed with a reduced work force.

00;16;52;02 - 00;17;13;17
Unknown
As we were going through this and they turned it down. But yet it did seem to ring a little hollow politically, because in 2013, the under the Obama administration, they asked for the exact same thing. And guess what the court did? They granted it. I think sometimes that we get involved in a little political here. And this one, unfortunately, smacks of political.

00;17;13;19 - 00;17;35;27
Unknown
Got it. Okay. Let's let's turn the page here and jump into some other veteran issues. Talk about veterans suicide. This is a fascinating one, because I know when you do the math, since 2008, it seems like we're spending more and more. We used to spend a little over 4 million back in oh eight on suicide, and we're up to over 500 million as of 2022.

00;17;36;00 - 00;18;07;09
Unknown
And you've teamed up or at least have this veterans Interoperability Pledge, which identifies veterans at risk. And you're also talking about measuring the effectiveness of these programs. By referrals to the VA or referrals to elements out there in the community, the community care. Tell me a little bit about this whole interoperability pledge and what the VA is doing hard and fast to address suicide, which sadly is still an issue.

00;18;07;11 - 00;18;28;00
Unknown
It is. I mean, and really, the numbers don't change. Since you said in 2008 you go from 4 million to 500 plus million, almost 600 million in preventative care, not to mention the 2.3 million we're using in treatment. And the numbers haven't changed. So and then the other number, the top on that is at 60% of those who, committed death by suicide had never had contact with the VA.

00;18;28;03 - 00;18;47;24
Unknown
So think about that. 60% of these veterans had not been in contact with the VA, but yet we're spending that much money. And to think about it for a second, to spend that much money with no real accountability or metrics to say, is this working or not? From my old Baptist preacher days, it's like I was turning around and and preaching to the choir and wondering why no new converts were coming out.

00;18;47;24 - 00;19;11;03
Unknown
Although some of my old choir members probably needed to come forward. Probably in that you find a few, but you don't find what you're looking for. You got to go where they are. And so what we're doing is we've reassessed our suicide prevention programs, and to go out to find those veterans who are, on the fringe, those who, are not involved, that 60% and continuing to see those that are already in our system.

00;19;11;05 - 00;19;28;05
Unknown
So that's why I do podcasts like this. That's why I've been on Sean Ryan, Jocko willing. I mean, we do I do football games, I go to NFL, I go to the, Major League Baseball. We're looking at UFC, we're looking at hunting. I've done hunting podcast and fishing. Because that's where the people are today. That's where these veterans are coming and we know it.

00;19;28;10 - 00;19;44;15
Unknown
And so when we can start seeing the number go down, we start seeing that more people are at least getting where they get care through the VA or somewhere else. My only goal is, is to reduce the number of every day seeing people and veterans who take, choose death by suicide in a faith that is, that's our metrics.

00;19;44;16 - 00;20;05;01
Unknown
Up until now, we've really not had that metric. It's been a ethereal goal to bring it down, but not really measuring it. That's why we've redone our whole suicide prevention office from leadership on down. We're actually focused on emailing. We're focused on contact. We're focused on, doing messages and, media that is hyper focused on getting to those veterans that we need to touch.

00;20;05;03 - 00;20;26;18
Unknown
Nice. Let me ask a crucial follow up question here, Julia, before you jump in on your next, I appreciate the reaching out. Certainly the touch points and the major pop culture podcasts like DeShawn Ryan and Rogan and and and Jocko. Great. Great way to get into the bloodstream, if you will, of the content veterans are watching.

00;20;26;21 - 00;20;47;15
Unknown
Have you any thoughts on the hard and fast differences it would make if we stopped prescribing so many psychoactive? From what I've heard, there are a great majority of veterans, certainly from the G.o.a.t. ERA, and my combat veteran brothers and sisters out there, they're taking a lot of these, you know, the Sarah quills and the benzodiazepines. They're also taking Wellbutrin for the smoking cessation.

00;20;47;17 - 00;21;18;12
Unknown
The drugs in the psychoactive category actually carry a black label that says they're dangerous to your mental health from the get go. Have you considered stopping so many psychoactive and beginning to examine the efficacy as proven by psychedelic medicine? The warfighter? Boone Cutler recently spoke for years on cannabis versus chronic pain meds. Where are you in actually changing the fundamentals of how their health is treated, and treating the health or the mental health that way?

00;21;18;14 - 00;21;35;03
Unknown
Yeah, we're definitely that is definitely something that's on my my mindset. Psychedelics have become a big issue here recently. I've, I, joke that I'm the first cabinet member to ever made out of the word psychedelics in a cabinet meeting. Other than talking about in a bad way. But, you know, is it a possibility for veterans to use?

00;21;35;03 - 00;21;55;13
Unknown
Yes. We have over 42 clinical styles going on in the VA right now, ranging from MDMA, psilocybin, and others that, we're using and working on, on ways and treatments. The biggest thing is you got to have the proper, trained personnel to do that, and we're trying to build that up. It it can't be. I can't just open it up tomorrow.

00;21;55;13 - 00;22;18;21
Unknown
Even if FDA said you could, we don't have enough trained psychiatrist and psychologist all to work with everybody. So we got to build that up. But we are seeing good results. And it takes us why I'm concerned that some of the studies, though actually are still doing the depressants with this. The psychedelics. And my concern is getting them off the, the depressant so that they can move on with life away from a drug free existence.

00;22;18;24 - 00;22;37;29
Unknown
And that should be the goal of psychedelics or anything else. And we're also in way from magnetic resonance to, hyperbaric. There's all kinds of stuff out there that we're looking at, to say, yes, I'm willing to do any of those things to help our veterans. Marijuana's an interesting issue. Part of it is a is a congressional kind of issue.

00;22;37;29 - 00;23;01;06
Unknown
I mean, we're we're working through some of that, as well. And you know, how it would help with some pain management and other things? I'm going to hit it because I'm often asked about this ibogaine issue. Ibogaine is is not legal. We can't deal with it in the United States. And so, I know it's been across the border in, Mexico and others that, they've had some, you know, successes with it.

I'm glad to say that if we're ever able to, clinically test that legally here, we'll I'm sure that that will be something we look at. Ibogaine is very different than some of the other psychedelics, especially on the treatment and especially some of the conditions related to heart and other things. So, I'm willing to look at anything that would help our veteran get back home, as we go.

00;23;20;06 - 00;23;39;02
Unknown
And we're also looking at, partnering. I've open the door to our non-profits who are out there doing some great work. There's been this thought in the VA. The VA had to do everything. Well, that's just not true. The VA doesn't have to do everything. We can be the biggest and best in so many times. But there's a lot of folks out there that can help us reach veterans in this area.

00;23;39;02 - 00;23;58;00
Unknown
And I want to continue to open those doors. Yeah. What are your thoughts on lowering the overall total of veterans on psychoactive, though? Because the DEA, it does seem the prescriptions come from their care providers, and I don't. Veterans that describe this is the new era of the combat cocktail. We're on all these antidepressant meds. What are your thoughts on that?

00;23;58;01 - 00;24;12;09
Unknown
We're trying to give our doctors in and stuff and against part of this is if you look at it into the community as a whole, I mean, you're looking at a reflection of the community. It's not just a reflection of veterans. I mean, how many, you know, just non veterans out there on these kind of medications every day.

00;24;12;09 - 00;24;31;25
Unknown
They're the most popular prescribed, the anti-depressants and others that they have. So it's it's a reflection of society right now that we got to look at and so I'm all for it using, you know, letting them figure out different ways to get people weaned off of medicines so that they can get home as long it is safe for the veteran to do it and safe for themselves.

00;24;31;28 - 00;24;52;18
Unknown
And so I'm off, you know, for ideas that can come of that. But I think one of the things that this hits into is we need to look at is it the VA is a health care system, just like every other health care system in this country. Unfortunately, we get scrutinized as if we are somehow different. And I want to say we're different in the sense that I get to take care of the best people in the world.

00;24;52;18 - 00;25;10;16
Unknown
I can take care of veterans and veterans only, but when it comes to the regular everyday medicine, I fight with Mayo and Cleveland Clinic and every private and public hospital in the country for doctors, nurses, clinicians, you know, and how we do stuff. Please. I mean, I hear this from Congress all the time. Well, why aren't you able to hire more doctors?

00;25;10;16 - 00;25;29;24
Unknown
Well, my question is, I'm glad you asked me that question, but we're doing pretty good, by the way, as comparison. But have you ask your private hospital in your hometown, if you ask your public hospital in your hometown, like, hey, how many doctors do you need right now? They're going to come back and tell you that they're having trouble hiring these people as well, because we have a health care clinician shortage, in our country.

00;25;29;24 - 00;25;52;13
Unknown
So we're doing everything we possibly can to not only give the best care we can, but also, you know, actually exist in a, ecosystem in which we're not the only player. Indeed. Fascinating. Look. And I know the devil's in the details very much, but to get into the weeds on some of this. So I thank you very much for, you know, giving me your perspective, a lot of that I just never heard before.

00;25;52;20 - 00;26;12;03
Unknown
Julia, you want to jump on, the act awaiting passage in Congress that we wanted to talk about real quick. Sure. And, Mr. Secretary, we were interested in the Major Star Act or VA's take on that. And what's happening. I mean, it's in two days. It's still there. Republicans kind of blocked it this time. What's going on?

00;26;12;03 - 00;26;30;13
Unknown
That was to the VA and with the with the major, with your star act. Okay. There's I think right now is this is a reflection of Congress. I mean, we're, we're you know, there is cost is a huge issue. With that, I think they've got to work that out for them, you know, say, you know, the the VA will support what Congress you know, directives give to us.

00;26;30;15 - 00;26;43;19
Unknown
I think the big issues you're going to have, there's cost. And then being able to figure out how to get, you know, their own internal pay for wars and things like that. It's not an open ended there's a lot of things we'd all love to do. But I also at the same time, is it fiscally prudent as well.

00;26;43;19 - 00;27;07;24
Unknown
And I think Congress is dealing with that. Got it. And for the listener, may not be familiar. We're inside baseball here. We both, you know, all of us veterans in this space. No, major Richard star. Of course it's. Does a veteran have the right to collect not only a retirement pay, but a disability benefit? With that, did you have any words for Senator Wicker?

00;27;07;27 - 00;27;43;23
Unknown
Who who who said it was double dipping for, injured veteran to get the payment due him for his injury and a retirement benefit for having served over two decades. He called that double dipping. You've served. You know what it that means. What words do you have for Senator Wicker? Well, I, I just hope that they'll sit down and and not just dig in, two positions and not look at the possibilities that could exist as someone who served in Congress for eight years with a with Senator Wicker and others, you know, look, we can we can have our positions, but in some things that there's also a moral obligation to look at and

00;27;43;23 - 00;28;05;01
Unknown
say, can we find a common ground solution here? I don't necessarily say I would go straight out to a double dipping kind of scenario. I think that's probably, harsh, in how we look at it. But I think we, as I just said a minute ago, I think finding the proper balance between how, we accept this and how we can, afford it is, is two things that are that they're going to have to work out.

00;28;05;08 - 00;28;19;16
Unknown
This isn't something I can handle here. If I if an ad had probably been, you know, there had been previous secretaries who've had to deal with it. So Congress is really going to have to look at what they want to, do in this regard. I leave that to them at this point. We gave them all the input, that we can.

00;28;19;16 - 00;28;39;19
Unknown
Of course, we stand ready, you know, to do whatever we need to do, I think is going to be a bigger conversation for them. And it's a lot of conversation on understanding the military culture and understanding what the, you know, the folks have given and how that actually affects them, apart from, the, the rest of the general public, if you would.

00;28;39;22 - 00;29;08;12
Unknown
Roger that. Okay. What's your secretary? What would be the VA's wish list if you could have you know, Christmas is coming. You're writing a letter to Santa Claus, so to speak. What would be your, on the VA's wish list in Congress? They could snap your fingers and say, I want a degree. What would that look like? I think the biggest thing is, is I love our congressional partners is just, to realize and I think help us as we move forward in making some our organizational changes, making, you know, things available make it easier.

00;29;08;14 - 00;29;27;10
Unknown
Many times in Congress, I think the big thing is, is, is there's a want to help. I don't question the motives of my colleagues in the Democratic Party, Republican Party, in wanting to help veterans. I think sometimes, though, it becomes an especially for some who've not served and even for some who have served. Remember, the vast, vast majority of members of Congress have never served in the military.

00;29;27;18 - 00;29;52;18
Unknown
So for them, it's I want to just help veterans because it's it's good thing to do for our country, but it's also politically good. I, I can honestly say that and, and and just, you know, understand it. So I think sometimes being working with us as a team and we're, we're willing to do that is work with us as a team to find out what is best that we need now, not what is a wish list for, you know, a certain constituent or something might have a definite issue.

00;29;52;24 - 00;30;13;07
Unknown
And then I think, just understand that our role in helping us be a health care system. I've been a disability benefits, you know, payer and also our cemeteries to know that our unique place that we fit in the infrastructure and helping us, with like, doctor pay, nurse pay, those kind of things like that. Yeah. Perfect. Okay.

00;30;13;10 - 00;30;28;15
Unknown
Well, I appreciate your time, Mr. Secretary. Really great getting to know you, getting to roll up the sleeves here, get into some issues. I know some of these issues are vexing, and they're not always easy to talk about, but I really do. You know, you were candid, and this is the most I've heard you speak on some of these subjects in a while.

00;30;28;15 - 00;30;42;16
Unknown
So, you know, I thank you very much for joining us, making the time. And, look forward to having you back. Will you come back? Can we can we do this once a quarter and just hang out? We'll we can do it. We can, we can we can make it happen on a on a regular basis. We'll talk to our folks.

00;30;42;16 - 00;31;01;26
Unknown
Okay? All right. Hey, last question for you. Real quick, college football wise, who are you and who you got this year? Go, dogs. I mean, there's no doubt about it. There's that little and little slice of heaven in Athens, Georgia, between the hedges. That's outstanding. Man. I'll be thinking of you on College GameDay. Look forward to having you back.

00;31;01;28 - 00;31;18;24
